# RedCell-Kali
Red Teaming with Kali Linux. OS Customization, additional tools, and automated updates

# Initial setup
```
git clone https://github.com/NECPC/RedCell-Kali.git
cd RedCell-Kali
./runonce.sh
./RedCell-Kali.sh
```

# Continued use
Once you have run the program once, it will create desktop shortcuts for quick and easy reference. Thus you can simply double-click the "RedCell-Kali.sh" script on the desktop from now on or run it from the command line - however you prefer.

The "RedCell-Kali.sh" script will operate as the primary script used to update this git repo (self-updating you say?? handy!), reiterate configuration settings, and ensure any other git repos that I have placed in /opt are also updated as well. Basically, the best way to make sure you always have the latest version of this script, is to simply run it.
